You are given some useful inclusions, a list of values and tolerances for each reading (all values share the same tolerances), and an enum with each values that you will need to keep track of the values in your battery vector. (use the enum to index into the vector).
You are also given three functions that are used to generate dummy values for the 'spacecraft EPS board'. Feel free to add or subtract from the given code as you see fit.
